# Website Roadmap

Status: active
Updated: 2026-07-13

## Implementation tracker

| Release | Status | Progress |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Release 1: Leaner and safer | Complete | Scene bundles, CI gates, JavaScript budgets, modal accessibility, reduced-motion handling, and Chromium/Firefox/WebKit coverage are verified. The optional physical-device font/render audit was skipped by maintainer direction. |
| Release 2: Easier to explore | Complete | Search, filters with URL state, discovery tags, question-led groupings, and related ideas are complete. The library browser passes Chromium, Firefox, and containerised WebKit coverage. |
| Release 3: Easier to share and trust | Complete | Meaningful scene state and guided steps are shareable; copy-link, clean embeds, visible WebGL fallback text, references, assumptions, methodology, unique canonical/social metadata, static preview images, and structured data are implemented and verified. |
| Release 4: Expand carefully | Complete | Regression parameters and decision-tree partitions shipped as a two-exhibit wave with deterministic models, shareable controls, static metadata, budgets, four-viewport coverage, and Chromium/Firefox/WebKit verification. |
| G0: Baseline and freeze | Complete | The 13-exhibit catalogue is frozen. The creative doctrine, flagship scorecard, signature states, and human-observation gate are defined in `docs/greatness-plan.md`. |
| G1: Gradient Descent flagship | Complete | Causal comparison defaults, stability regimes, direct annotations, deterministic signature states, responsive camera targeting, orbit inspection, and shareable state are implemented and verified. |
| G2: Feedback incorporation | Complete | The first observation and subsequent maintainer review produced concrete revisions. Formal participant observation no longer blocks progress; reported issues will continue to be corrected directly. |
| G3: Reusable grammar | Complete for current wave | The second-use rule produced one shared kept-comparison command. Trajectories, fitted curves, annotations, and causal summaries remain exhibit-owned. |
| G4: Later flagships | Complete | Overfitting and Decision Tree Partitions apply kept comparisons to error curves and spatial routing without forcing identical choreography. Their computed states, URL restoration, responsive layouts, and visual baselines are verified. |
| G5: Homepage re-authoring | Complete | The first screen contains a real Gradient Descent micro-experiment using the flagship model, followed by three featured exhibits, question-led browsing, concrete implementation notes, and the complete collection. Four-viewport and interaction checks pass. |
| G6: Identity decision | Complete | Keep the descriptive name. Identity comes from the visual and interaction system; public copy follows the literal language rules in `docs/identity-decision.md`. |
| D1: Static distribution groundwork | Complete | Contributor requirements, a tested non-destructive exhibit scaffold, state-link and iframe documentation, static-hosting instructions, and updated social copy are implemented and verified. |
| D2: Reuse licence | Pending owner decision | The repository still needs an explicit code/content reuse decision before it can be described as openly reusable. |
| A1: Attention fidelity | Complete | Attention scores and softmax weights are computed from disclosed tiny query/key vectors. Shareable controls, four reviewed signature states, responsive layouts, and browser restoration are verified. |
| A2: Attention comparison | Complete | Changing the sentence ending retains the previous computed distribution as per-token markers and names the largest weight shifts while holding head and query constant. The comparison, URL restoration, responsive layout, and browser behavior are verified. |
| K1: Kernel fidelity | Complete | The exhibit now frames one explicit radial feature map, connects a computed horizontal threshold to its exact circular input-space boundary, distinguishes view interpolation from model parameters, preserves orbit inspection, and restores the view from the URL. Four signature states and the full repository gate are verified. |
| S1: Social visual arguments | Complete | All 16 public Open Graph images now use route-specific mechanism diagrams instead of one generic decorative motif. Registry alignment, raster dimensions, distinct output, metadata, and the static build are verified. |
| P1: PCA direct projection | Complete | Equivalent undirected axes are normalised into the native slider range, the projection axis can be rotated directly on the plot, and integer angle state is URL-restorable. Pointer, responsive, model, and browser behavior are verified. |
| C1: CNN receptive-field state | Complete | Filter and output-cell coordinates are URL-restorable, the focusable diagram moves the receptive field with arrow keys, and its live description reports the exact patch response. Automatic scanning remains transient. |
| B1: Backpropagation replay state | Complete | Inputs, target, learning rate, and update count reconstruct weights deterministically from the authored starting network. Changing evidence resets incompatible update history, and the complete state is URL-restorable. |
| V1: Public visual language | Complete | The generic homepage feature band is removed, the hero names concrete manipulations and disclosures, methodology metadata uses literal descriptions, and sharing now means the stable exhibit route. |
| U1: Homepage fold repair | Complete | The hero now carries its own computed result: one `--layout-header-height` token replaces the 60/72/84/116 disagreement, the result sentence sits beneath the slider inside the hero, the chart is budgeted against viewport height (300px at 1440×900, up from 230px), the mobile CTA is above the fold, and a diverging path is drawn to its exact domain crossing instead of collapsing to a dot. A seven-viewport e2e assertion holds the slider, chart, and result above the fold. See `docs/ux-improvement-plan.md`. |
| U2: Homepage concept field | Complete | The edge layer now shares the nodes' coordinate space: the SVG stretches with `preserveAspectRatio="none"`, endpoints use the same percentage clamp as the node positions, and strokes are non-scaling. Edge and node spans coincide within 2px where they previously differed by 297px, node labels no longer clip, and the meaningless centre crosshairs are gone. An e2e assertion covers the alignment and was verified to fail without the fix. |
| Q1: Classroom quiz | Complete (relay deploy pending) | A live quiz for Level 3 at `/play/host` and `/play`: teacher-started sessions behind a teacher passcode, joined by code or QR code, generated nicknames, top three only, every question asked twice with spaced, reshuffled repeats, and everything deleted when the session ends. A Cloudflare relay (`relay/`) passes messages and keeps no game data. BTEC AAQ IT Unit 3 sets for Topics 2, 4 and 12 with rendered figures. Game, set, relay and browser tests pass. See `docs/classroom-quiz.md`. |
| E1: Causal mechanism pass | Complete | Genetic Algorithm shows the actual crossover child and changed mutation bits. Particle Swarm decomposes one computed move into inertia, personal, shared, and optional repulsion arrows while preserving orbit. Both pass the static, model, viewport, and budget gates. |

Update this tracker in the same change that completes or materially advances a
roadmap item. A release is complete only after its completion criteria have been
verified.

Exact scene-state sharing is closed to further expansion by maintainer
direction. “Copy exhibit link” now copies the stable exhibit route without
guided-step or control parameters. Existing parameter restoration remains
supported where already implemented, but it is not a requirement for the
remaining exhibits.

### Greatness phase implementation log

  comparisons, make their cleared state URL-restorable, and reset the 3D camera
  with the exhibit lifecycle.

  and causal summary independent.
- [x] Make the Decision Tree root boundary directly draggable, seed a kept root
  comparison, and distinguish root rerouting from changed predictions and

  five overlapping visitor questions while preserving the complete collection
  lower on the page.

- [x] Capture and review five deterministic 1440×900 states for each of
  Gradient Descent, Overfitting, and Decision Tree Partitions.
- [x] Close G6 without a rename: retain the descriptive title and document the
  visual and plain-language identity rules in `docs/identity-decision.md`.
- [x] Add a non-destructive `scaffold:exhibit` command that creates a model,
  metadata definition, accessible scene, and focused tests, then names every
  registration step still required.

  per-token markers, and state the two largest computed changes.
- [x] Make the kept ending replaceable, clearable, and URL-restorable without
  duplicating the curve diagram.

  assertion.
- [x] Fix the PCA perpendicular preset so its visible axis and native slider
  agree on an equivalent angle inside the -90 to 90 degree range.
- [x] Make the PCA plot a direct pointer/touch rotation surface while retaining
  the slider and principal-axis command as keyboard controls.
- [x] Restore and share the selected PCA angle through the URL, including a
  browser drag-and-reload assertion.

  the automatic scan out of persistent URL state.
- [x] Add arrow-key cell movement and a live nonvisual patch/filter response to
  match the existing pointer cell selection.
- [x] Correct the CNN assumptions to state that fixed 2×2 max pooling is shown,
  rather than incorrectly listing pooling as omitted.
- [x] Verify CNN with 181 unit/component tests, lint, the static export, every
  route budget, 78 Chromium checks, and all four Firefox and WebKit smoke
  checks; inspect the restored sharpen/filter state at 390×844 directly.
- [x] Replace Backpropagation's history-dependent mutable weights with a
  deterministic replay from authored starting weights for the current inputs,
  target, learning rate, and update count.
- [x] Reset applied updates when evidence or rate changes, and encode the full
  reproducible training state in the URL.

  share the stable exhibit route without parameter state.
- [x] Record the Genetic Algorithm's displayed reproduction example directly
  from the deterministic model, distinguish crossover from mutation, highlight
  changed bits, and correct the selection disclosure from fitness-proportional
  to two-candidate tournament selection.
- [x] Extract Particle Swarm's exact inertia, personal, shared, and repulsion
  components from the model; render a raised, uniformly enlarged arrow chain
  for one camera-legible particle while retaining free orbit and the full-swarm
  forecast.
- [x] Verify the wave with lint, 190 unit/component tests, the 21-page static
  export, every route budget, all 79 Chromium scenarios, a post-tuning
  four-viewport Particle Swarm run, and a nonblank 300-colour Firefox WebGL
  capture reviewed at 1440x900.

  Playwright 1.61.1 container.
- [x] Skip the representative physical-device font/loading audit by maintainer
  direction; the automated 390×844 viewport remains covered in Chromium.

### Release 2 implementation log

Updated: 2026-07-12

- [x] Give every exhibit a stable `tags` set and expose lightweight
  `exhibitSummaries` for discovery without shipping steps/challenges.
- [x] Add client-side search over titles, questions, summaries, and tags in a
  pure, unit-tested `search` module (every term must match).
- [x] Add topic, difficulty, length, and renderer filters via a
  `LibraryBrowser` client component.
- [x] Encode filter state in query parameters (`q`, `topic`, `difficulty`,
  `renderer`, `duration`), omit defaults, and ignore invalid or stale values.
- [x] Replace the inactive "All topics" label with real browsing controls, a
  live result count, a clear-filters action, and an empty state.
- [x] Add non-prescriptive `related` links per exhibit, surfaced as "Related
  ideas" inside the insight drawer.
- [x] Reframe the homepage groupings as "Explore by question" / related ideas
  with non-ordinal keywords instead of numbered learning paths.
- [x] Verify lint, 119 unit/component tests (34 new), the production build, all
  route budgets (library 189.7/210 KiB), and 54 Chromium browser checks.
- [x] Extend Firefox/WebKit smoke coverage to the library browser.
- [x] Verify the library browser smoke check in Firefox locally.
- [x] Verify the library browser smoke check in the matching official
  Playwright 1.61.1 WebKit container.

### Release 3 implementation log

Updated: 2026-07-12

- [x] Add concise assumptions/simplifications and references to each exhibit's
  metadata (`assumptions`, `references` with optional stable links).
- [x] Render "What is simplified" and "References" sections in the insight
  drawer, with external references opening in a new tab.
- [x] Verify lint, 130 unit/component tests (11 new), the production build, all
  route budgets, and the drawer Chromium check.
- [x] Extend the `?step=` convention to validated, non-default scene parameters
  for gradient-descent surface/learning rate, polynomial degree, and token
  sampling temperature/truncation controls.
- [x] Add a resilient "Copy current view" action and verify that a shared scene
  state restores after reload without storage, cookies, or identifiers.
- [x] Add a clean `embed=1` presentation without global navigation, retaining
  keyboard controls and a link back to the full view.
- [x] Add a visible explanatory fallback when WebGL is unavailable.

  JavaScript budget, all 58 Chromium checks, and all three Firefox smoke checks.
- [x] Verify all three WebKit smoke checks in the matching official Playwright
  1.61.1 container (3/3 passed).

### Release 4 implementation log

Updated: 2026-07-12

- [x] Select regression parameters and decision-tree partitions as a two-exhibit
  wave using the visual-argument test.
- [x] Regression answers how slope/intercept move both predictions and position
  on a loss surface; visitors manipulate model type, slope, and intercept. This
  connects parameter geometry to loss, which the abstract optimisation exhibit
  does not. The compact authored datasets and losses are deterministic.
- [x] Decision trees answer how nested rules carve feature space; visitors
  manipulate depth and the root threshold. This exposes inherited rectangular
  partitions, which no existing boundary exhibit shows. Routing and accuracy
  use a deterministic authored dataset.
- [x] Add guided steps, challenges, references, simplification disclosures,
  discovery tags, related ideas, and nonvisual live descriptions to both.
- [x] Encode non-default regression and tree controls in shareable URLs.
- [x] Add both routes to static generation, library/home discovery, sitemap,
  route budgets, canonical/social metadata, and generated preview images.
- [x] Add deterministic model tests and component interaction/preset tests.
- [x] Verify lint, 150 unit/component tests, the 13-route static export, every
  JavaScript budget, and all 66 Chromium checks across 390×844, 768×1024,
  1280×720, and 1440×900.
- [x] Verify all four smoke checks, including direct interaction with both new
  exhibits, in Firefox and containerised WebKit (4/4 in each).

## Direction

Take the website forward as a focused, static library of interactive machine-
learning visualisations. It is not a course, curriculum, learning-management
system, or user-tracking product. Each visualisation should remain useful on its
own: a visitor arrives with a question, manipulates the idea, understands the
mechanism, and leaves with a clearer mental model.

The site should stay:

- fully static and deployable to GitHub Pages;
- private by default, with no analytics, tracking pixels, cookies, accounts, or
  stored visitor profiles;
- open to non-linear exploration, without lessons, prerequisites, completion
  states, streaks, quizzes, or forced sequences;
- centred on direct manipulation rather than long-form teaching content;
- fast, accessible, shareable, and credible;
- visually distinctive without acquiring unnecessary product machinery.

## Current position

The foundation is already strong:

- thirteen purpose-built visualisations cover optimisation, generalisation,
  clustering, dimensionality reduction, classical machine learning, deep
  learning, evolutionary computation, and language models;
- every exhibit uses a compact, one-viewport workspace;
- the site is statically generated and has no backend requirement;
- deterministic models have unit tests and key scenes have component tests;
- Playwright checks every exhibit at four representative viewport sizes;
- lint, 150 unit/component tests, the production build, route budgets, and the
  Chromium/Firefox/WebKit suites currently pass.

The next stage should improve the quality and reach of the library before
expanding its size aggressively.

## Product principles

1. **One exhibit, one visual argument.** Every scene should make a specific
   relationship visible rather than act as a generic chart or simulation.
2. **Exploration is non-linear.** Topic groupings can help visitors browse, but
   must not imply a required syllabus or progression.
3. **Interaction comes first.** Supporting explanation should remain concise
   and should not push the visualisation out of the viewport.
4. **The URL is the state boundary.** When an exhibit state is worth preserving,
   encode it in the URL rather than storing it against a visitor.
5. **No surveillance as a feature.** Do not add behavioural analytics, session
   recording, advertising scripts, fingerprinting, or engagement tracking.
6. **Static by design.** Prefer build-time content, browser-native features, and
   GitHub-based project workflows over servers and databases.
7. **Depth before volume.** Improve weak visual explanations and missing context
   before adding another topic.

## Phase 1: Performance and delivery

Goal: make every exhibit load only what it needs and make deployment reliably
verify the site.

### Work

- Separate lightweight exhibit metadata from scene component imports.
- Dynamically load the requested scene so an SVG exhibit does not download the
  rest of the library or the WebGL stack.
- Measure generated asset sizes and set route-level JavaScript budgets.
- Keep Three.js isolated to the exhibits that genuinely require 3D.
- Run lint, unit tests, the production build, and Playwright in CI before the
  deployment job is allowed to publish.
- Add small Firefox and WebKit smoke suites for navigation, controls, SVG
  rendering, and WebGL fallback.
- Audit font loading and initial rendering on a mid-range mobile device.

### Completion criteria

- Each exhibit route ships only its own scene code and shared shell code.
- A failed validation step prevents deployment.
- Static export remains the only production artefact.
- The main pages meet documented performance budgets on mobile and desktop.

## Phase 2: Better library discovery

Goal: help visitors find a relevant visualisation without turning the site into
a course catalogue.

### Work

- Add client-side search over titles, questions, summaries, and topics.
- Add simple topic, difficulty, duration, and renderer filters.
- Put filter state in query parameters so filtered library views can be linked.
- Replace the inactive "All topics" label with real browsing controls.
- Add compact related-visualisation links to each workspace, based on conceptual
  relationships rather than a prescribed next lesson.
- Reframe homepage groupings as "Explore by question" or "Related ideas" rather
  than learning paths.
- Give every exhibit a stable set of tags for discovery and build-time metadata.

### Completion criteria

- Every exhibit can be found by both its formal name and the question it answers.
- Topic groupings never imply required order or completion.
- Search and filters work entirely in the browser with no network service.
- Filtered views remain usable without cookies or local storage.

## Phase 3: Sharable interactive states

Goal: make individual discoveries easy to reproduce while keeping the site
stateless and private.

### Work

- Extend the existing `?step=` convention to meaningful scene parameters where
  practical, such as learning rate, polynomial degree, temperature, or selected
  token.
- Add a "Copy current view" action using the browser clipboard API.
- Ensure shared URLs restore the same deterministic state.
- Keep URLs readable by omitting default values and rejecting invalid values.
- Add a clean embed presentation controlled by a URL parameter or dedicated
  static route, without the global navigation.
- Provide a static fallback summary when WebGL is unavailable.

### Completion criteria

- Important exhibit configurations can be shared as ordinary URLs.
- Shared state requires no database, account, cookie, or browser identifier.
- Embedded exhibits remain keyboard accessible and link back to the full view.

## Phase 4: Authority, context, and accessibility

Goal: make the visual explanations trustworthy and usable without burying them
under textbook material.

### Work

- Add concise references, assumptions, and simplifications to each insight
  drawer.
- Clearly identify hand-authored datasets and illustrative model outputs.
- Add equations or notation only where they clarify what the visitor is
  manipulating.
- Add a small methodology/about page covering the visualisation approach,
  author, source repository, licence, and accessibility commitment.
- Make the insight drawer fully modal: Escape to close, trapped focus, restored
  focus, and inert background content.
- Verify that autoplay and continuous scene motion respect reduced-motion
  preferences.
- Review colour contrast, non-colour encodings, touch target sizes, screen-reader
  descriptions, and keyboard operation.
- Add automated accessibility smoke checks while retaining manual review.

### Completion criteria

- Every exhibit states what is real, simplified, or hand-authored.
- Every interactive control is operable by keyboard and touch.
- The complete idea remains available through a nonvisual description.
- Supporting context stays inside the existing compact drawer pattern.

## Phase 5: Search and social presentation

Goal: make static pages understandable when discovered through search engines,
links, and social previews without observing visitor behaviour.

### Work

- Give every exhibit its own canonical URL rather than inheriting the homepage
  canonical.
- Generate a static Open Graph image for the homepage, library, and each exhibit.
- Add per-exhibit Open Graph and social metadata at build time.
- Add appropriate structured data for an educational interactive resource,
  without making course or accreditation claims.
- Improve page descriptions around the question each exhibit answers.
- Ensure the sitemap, manifest, `robots.txt`, favicon, and social images use the
  configured production base URL correctly.
- Add a human-readable static index of topics for crawlers and visitors.

### Completion criteria

- Every public route has a unique title, description, canonical URL, and preview.
- Link previews communicate the actual visual idea rather than generic branding.
- No SEO work introduces scripts, tracking, or server-side infrastructure.

## Phase 6: Selective exhibit expansion

Goal: broaden the library only where a new exhibit adds a distinct visual idea.

### Candidate topics

1. **Linear and logistic regression (shipped in Release 4)** — connect a
   decision boundary to a loss surface and parameter changes.
2. **Decision trees (shipped in Release 4)** — show how a sequence of
   axis-aligned splits partitions feature space.
3. **Embeddings** — expose neighbourhoods, analogy directions, and the limits of
   distance-based interpretation.
4. **Transformer block** — connect attention, residual connections,
   normalisation, and token updates in one compact flow.
5. **Bias and variance** — compare repeated fitted models rather than duplicating
   the existing overfitting exhibit.
6. **Reinforcement learning** — show how value estimates change through a small,
   deterministic environment.

### Selection test

Before implementing a candidate, require clear answers to all of the following:

- What single question does it answer?
- What can the visitor directly manipulate?
- What causal relationship becomes visible?
- Why is the idea not already covered by an existing exhibit?
- Can the complete interaction fit the established workspace?
- Can its model and important states be deterministic and testable?

Add exhibits in waves of no more than two or three, followed by visual,
accessibility, performance, and cross-browser review.

## Phase 7: Open, static distribution

Goal: let other people reuse and improve the work without creating a platform or
service.

### Work

- Document how to embed a visualisation with a normal URL or iframe.
- Provide a concise contributor guide and an exhibit scaffold.
- Document metadata, deterministic-model, accessibility, and viewport
  requirements for new exhibits.
- Add static downloadable diagrams or print-friendly summaries only where they
  are useful outside the interactive view.
- Use GitHub issues or discussions for feedback rather than building an in-site
  feedback backend.
- Consider offline caching only if it can remain a simple static enhancement and
  does not complicate updates or correctness.

## Recommended release sequence

### Release 1: Leaner and safer

- split the registry and route bundles;
- add full CI validation before deployment;
- fix modal behaviour and reduced-motion handling;
- establish performance budgets.

### Release 2: Easier to explore

- add static client-side search and filters;
- replace course-like path language with question-led topic groupings;
- add related concepts without prescribed ordering.

### Release 3: Easier to share and trust

- add URL-encoded exhibit states and copy-link support;
- add references, assumptions, and methodology;
- add route-specific canonical metadata and social previews;
- add the clean embed view.

### Release 4: Expand carefully

- select the next two exhibits using the visual-argument test;
- ship them with the same deterministic, accessibility, viewport, and static-
  export guarantees as the existing library.

## Explicit non-goals

The following are outside the intended direction:

- analytics and behavioural event tracking;
- accounts, profiles, authentication, or cloud-saved state;
- progress tracking, completion badges, streaks, points, or certificates;
- lessons, courses, syllabuses, assessments, or prerequisite gates;
- personalised recommendations based on visitor behaviour;
- comments, social feeds, or an in-site community backend;
- APIs, databases, or server rendering that compromise static deployment;
- advertising, sponsorship tracking, or marketing automation;
- adding exhibits merely to increase the library count.

## Ongoing quality checklist

For every change:

- preserve static export and GitHub Pages deployment;
- avoid third-party runtime scripts unless they are essential and privacy-safe;
- test at 390x844, 768x1024, 1280x720, and 1440x900;
- verify pointer, touch, keyboard, screen-reader, and reduced-motion behaviour;
- keep the visualisation and essential controls within the workspace viewport;
- keep model behaviour deterministic where possible;
- update unit, component, and browser tests in proportion to the change;
- check that the change makes an idea clearer, the site easier to explore, or
  the implementation more robust.
