    title: "Linear Regression",
    category: "Supervised",
    shortDescription:
      "Predicts a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables.",
    fullDescription:
      "Linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. It is one of the most well-known and well-understood algorithms in statistics and machine learning.",
    intuition:
      'Imagine you want to predict the price of a house based on its size. You plot past data on a graph (size on the x-axis, price on the y-axis). Linear regression finds the "line of best fit" through this data, allowing you to estimate the price for any given size.',
    mathematics: `For a single input feature, linear regression is often written as:

$$ \\hat{y} = mx + b $$

More generally, with $p$ features collected into a vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$:

$$ \\hat{y} = w^T x + b $$

Where:
- $\\hat{y}$ = predicted value
- $x$ = input feature vector
- $w$ = weight vector (one weight per feature)
- $b$ = bias (intercept) term

### Loss Function

The most common fitting criterion is **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**, which minimises the **Mean Squared Error**:

$$ \\mathcal{L}(w, b) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 $$

### Closed-Form Solution

Absorbing $b$ into $w$ by appending a constant 1 to every input vector, the OLS objective has a **closed-form solution** (the Normal Equation):

$$ \\hat{w} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y $$

This is valid whenever $X^T X$ is invertible (i.e., the features are not perfectly collinear).

### Gradient for Iterative Optimisation

When a closed-form solve is impractical (e.g., very large $p$), one can use **gradient descent**. The gradient of the MSE with respect to $w$ is:

$$ \\nabla_w \\mathcal{L} = -\\frac{2}{n} X^T (y - Xw) $$

### Ridge Regularization

To stabilise coefficients when features are correlated, **Ridge regression** adds an L2 penalty:

$$ \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ridge}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\lambda \\|w\\|^2 $$

Its closed-form solution becomes:

$$ \\hat{w}_{\\text{ridge}} = (X^T X + \\lambda I)^{-1} X^T y $$

The penalty $\\lambda > 0$ shrinks coefficients toward zero, trading a small increase in bias for a potentially large decrease in variance.`,

      "Fast to train and predict.",

    shortDescription:
      "Predicts the probability of a categorical target variable (binary classification).",
    fullDescription:
      "Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm. In the binary case, it models the probability that a given input belongs to class 1 by applying the logistic sigmoid function to a linear score. Multiclass extensions typically use the softmax function.",
    intuition:
      'If you want to classify emails as "Spam" or "Not Spam", logistic regression calculates a score based on keywords. It then passes this score through a "S-shaped" curve (Sigmoid) to get a probability between 0 and 1. If it\'s over 0.5, it\'s Spam!',
    mathematics: `For binary classification, logistic regression maps a linear score to a probability using the sigmoid function:

$$ P(y=1|x) = \\sigma(w^T x + b) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w^T x + b)}} $$

Equivalently, it models the **log-odds** as a linear function of the inputs:

$$ \\log \\frac{P(y=1|x)}{P(y=0|x)} = w^T x + b $$

### Binary Cross-Entropy Loss

The parameters are estimated by **maximum likelihood**, which is equivalent to minimizing the binary cross-entropy loss:

$$ \\mathcal{L}(w,b) = -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i)\\log(1-\\hat{y}_i)\\right] $$

### Gradient Derivation

The gradient of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the weights has a remarkably clean form:

$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_j} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y}_i - y_i) \\, x_{ij} $$

In matrix form:

$$ \\nabla_w \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{n} X^T (\\hat{y} - y) $$

This simplicity arises because the sigmoid is the canonical link function for Bernoulli likelihoods.

### L2-Regularized Update

Adding an L2 penalty to prevent overfitting, the gradient-descent parameter update becomes:

$$ w \\leftarrow w - \\eta \\left( \\frac{1}{n} X^T (\\hat{y} - y) + \\lambda w \\right) $$

where $\\eta$ is the learning rate and $\\lambda$ controls the strength of regularisation.`,

      "Classifies data points based on the labels of their nearest neighbours.",
    fullDescription:
      'K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm. It doesn\'t learn a discriminative function from the training data but "memorizes" the dataset instead. Classification is performed by a majority vote of its neighbours.',
    intuition:
      '"Tell me who your neighbours are, and I\'ll tell you who you are." To classify a new point, KNN looks at the $K$ closest points in the training set. If most of them are "Red", the new point is classified as "Red".',
    mathematics: `### Distance Metrics

The choice of distance metric is fundamental to KNN. The **Minkowski distance** family unifies several common metrics:

$$ d_p(x, z) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - z_i|^p \\right)^{1/p} $$

Special cases:
- $p = 1$: **Manhattan distance** — sum of absolute differences
- $p = 2$: **Euclidean distance** — straight-line distance
- $p \\to \\infty$: **Chebyshev distance** — maximum coordinate difference

### Classification Rule

For KNN classification, the prediction for a query point $x$ is the majority class among its nearest neighbours:

$$ \\hat{y} = \\operatorname{mode}(\\{y_i : i \\in N_k(x)\\}) $$

Where $N_k(x)$ is the set of the $k$ training points closest to $x$.

### Weighted KNN

A common refinement is **distance-weighted voting**, where closer neighbours contribute more:

$$ \\hat{y} = \\operatorname{argmax}_{c} \\sum_{i \\in N_k(x)} w_i \\cdot \\mathbf{1}[y_i = c], \\quad w_i = \\frac{1}{d(x, x_i)^2} $$

### Curse of Dimensionality

In high dimensions, distances become less discriminative. As dimensionality $d$ grows, the ratio of the distance to the nearest neighbor versus the farthest neighbor converges toward 1, making all points appear roughly equidistant. This is why **feature selection** and **dimensionality reduction** are critical for KNN in practice.`,

    id: "support-vector-machines",
    title: "Support Vector Machines",
    category: "Supervised",
    shortDescription:
      "Finds the optimal hyperplane that maximises the margin between different classes.",
    fullDescription:
      'Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are maximum-margin classifiers that seek a separating boundary with the largest possible margin between classes. In linear SVMs this boundary is a hyperplane; with kernels, the decision boundary can be non-linear in the original input space. Points that lie on or inside the margin are called "support vectors".',
    intuition:
      'Imagine trying to separate two groups of points with a wide "no-man\'s land" (the margin). SVM tries to find the widest possible path that separates the groups without touching any points.',
    mathematics: `### Hard-Margin Objective

For the hard-margin linear SVM, the goal is to maximize the geometric margin $M = \\frac{2}{\\|w\\|}$ subject to the separation constraints:

$$ y_i (w^T x_i + b) \\ge 1, \\quad \\forall\\, i $$

This is equivalent to minimizing $\\frac{1}{2}\\|w\\|^2$ subject to the same constraints.

### Soft-Margin SVM

In practice, most SVMs use a **soft margin**, introducing slack variables $\\xi_i \\ge 0$ and a regularisation parameter $C$:

$$ \\min_{w, b, \\xi} \\; \\frac{1}{2} \\|w\\|^2 + C \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_i $$

$$ \\text{s.t.} \\quad y_i(w^T x_i + b) \\ge 1 - \\xi_i, \\quad \\xi_i \\ge 0 $$

Larger $C$ penalizes misclassifications more heavily; smaller $C$ allows a wider but less accurate margin.

### Lagrangian Dual

Using Lagrange multipliers $\\alpha_i \\ge 0$, the dual formulation becomes:

$$ \\max_\\alpha \\; \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_i - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} \\alpha_i \\alpha_j\\, y_i y_j\\, x_i^T x_j $$

$$ \\text{s.t.} \\quad 0 \\le \\alpha_i \\le C, \\quad \\sum_i \\alpha_i y_i = 0 $$

Only the support vectors have $\\alpha_i > 0$.

### The Kernel Trick

For non-linear decision boundaries, SVMs use the **kernel trick**, replacing dot products $x_i^T x_j$ with $K(x_i, x_j)$:

$$ K(x_i, x_j) = \\phi(x_i)^T \\phi(x_j) $$

Common kernels:
- **Polynomial**: $K(x, z) = (x^T z + c)^d$
- **RBF (Gaussian)**: $K(x, z) = \\exp\\left(-\\gamma \\|x - z\\|^2\\right)$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}$

The RBF kernel implicitly maps to an infinite-dimensional feature space.`,

    intuition:
      'Think of a game of "20 Questions". You ask: "Is the animal a mammal?", "Does it fly?", "Is it a bat?". Each question narrows down the possibilities until you reach a final answer.',
    mathematics: `### Impurity Measures

For classification trees, a split is chosen by maximizing **impurity reduction**. Two common impurity measures for a node $D$ with $c$ classes are:

**Gini impurity**:

$$ \\text{Gini}(D) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i^2 $$

**Entropy**:

$$ H(D) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \\log_2(p_i) $$

where $p_i$ is the fraction of samples belonging to class $i$ in node $D$.

### Information Gain

A split on feature $f$ at threshold $t$ divides node $D$ into left child $D_L$ and right child $D_R$. The **information gain** is:

$$ IG(D, f, t) = H(D) - \\frac{|D_L|}{|D|} H(D_L) - \\frac{|D_R|}{|D|} H(D_R) $$

The algorithm greedily selects the split $(f, t)$ that maximises $IG$.

### Gini Decrease

Similarly, with the Gini index the best split maximises:

$$ \\Delta \\text{Gini}(D, f, t) = \\text{Gini}(D) - \\frac{|D_L|}{|D|} \\text{Gini}(D_L) - \\frac{|D_R|}{|D|} \\text{Gini}(D_R) $$

### Regression Trees

For regression, splits typically minimise the **variance** (or equivalently MSE) within each child node:

$$ \\text{MSE}(D) = \\frac{1}{|D|} \\sum_{i \\in D} (y_i - \\bar{y}_D)^2 $$

where $\\bar{y}_D$ is the mean target value inside node $D$.`,

    intuition:
      'Instead of asking one expert, you ask many. Each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and at every split it considers only a random subset of features. This diversity makes the ensemble much more stable than a single decision tree.',
    mathematics: `Random forests combine **bagging** with **random feature selection**:

1. Draw $B$ bootstrap samples from the training data.
2. Train a tree $T_b$ on each bootstrap sample.
3. At each split, consider only a random subset of $m < p$ features.

### Aggregation

For regression, predictions are averaged:

$$ \\hat{f}(x) = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} T_b(x) $$

For classification, predictions are typically aggregated by majority vote or by averaging class probabilities.

### Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error

Each bootstrap sample leaves out roughly $1 - \\frac{1}{e} \\approx 36.8\\%$ of the data. These **out-of-bag** samples serve as a built-in validation set:

$$ \\text{OOB error} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{1}\\left[\\hat{y}_i^{\\text{OOB}} \\neq y_i\\right] $$

where $\\hat{y}_i^{\\text{OOB}}$ is the prediction using only trees that did **not** train on sample $i$.

### Variance Reduction (Bias-Variance View)

A single deep tree has low bias but high variance. Averaging $B$ trees reduces variance:

$$ \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{B}\\sum_b T_b\\right) = \\rho \\sigma^2 + \\frac{1-\\rho}{B} \\sigma^2 $$

where $\\rho$ is the average pairwise correlation between trees and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of a single tree. Random feature subsets reduce $\\rho$, which is the key insight behind random forests.`,

### Pseudo-Residuals

At iteration $m$, the new learner is fit to the negative gradient of the loss with respect to the current model output:

$$ r_{im} = -\\left[\\frac{\\partial L(y_i, f(x_i))}{\\partial f(x_i)}\\right]_{f=f_{m-1}} $$

      'Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning model used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes\' Theorem with the "naive" assumption that features are conditionally independent given the class label.',
    intuition:
      "If you see an animal that is large, has a trunk, and is grey, Naive Bayes calculates the probability of it being an Elephant by multiplying the probabilities of each trait independently. It's fast and remarkably effective for text spam filtering!",
    mathematics: `### Bayes' Theorem

The foundation of Naive Bayes is **Bayes' Theorem**:

$$ P(C|X) = \\frac{P(X|C) \\, P(C)}{P(X)} $$

### Conditional Independence Assumption

For a feature vector $x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$, the model assumes that features are **conditionally independent** given the class $C$:

$$ P(x_1, \\ldots, x_n | C) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | C) $$

### Classification Rule

The classifier selects the class $C$ that maximises the posterior probability:

$$ \\hat{y} = \\operatorname{argmax}_{c} \\; P(C=c) \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | C=c) $$

Where:
- $P(C=c)$ is the **prior** probability of the class
- $P(x_i | C=c)$ is the **likelihood** of feature $i$ given the class

### Likelihood Models

The form of $P(x_i | C)$ depends on the data type:
- **Gaussian NB** (continuous features): $P(x_i | C) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_C^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x_i - \\mu_C)^2}{2\\sigma_C^2}\\right)$
- **Multinomial NB** (count features): $P(x_i | C) \\propto \\theta_{Ci}^{x_i}$
- **Bernoulli NB** (binary features): $P(x_i | C) = \\theta_{Ci}^{x_i}(1 - \\theta_{Ci})^{1 - x_i}$

### Laplace Smoothing

To avoid zero probabilities when a feature-class combination is unseen in training, **Laplace smoothing** adds a pseudocount $\\alpha$:

$$ \\hat{P}(x_i | C) = \\frac{\\text{count}(x_i, C) + \\alpha}{\\text{count}(C) + \\alpha \\cdot |V|} $$

where $|V|$ is the number of distinct values (vocabulary size). Setting $\\alpha = 1$ is standard Laplace smoothing.`,

    mathematics: `### Objective

The algorithm minimises the **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)**:

$$ J = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\sum_{i \\in C_j} \\|x_i - \\mu_j\\|^2 $$

Where $\\mu_j$ is the centroid of cluster $C_j$.

### Lloyd's Algorithm (EM View)

K-Means can be viewed as a special case of the **Expectation-Maximization** algorithm with hard assignments:

**E-step (Assignment)**: Assign each point to the nearest centroid:

$$ c_i = \\operatorname{argmin}_{j} \\|x_i - \\mu_j\\|^2 $$

**M-step (Update)**: Recompute each centroid as the mean of its assigned points:

$$ \\mu_j = \\frac{1}{|C_j|} \\sum_{i \\in C_j} x_i $$

### Convergence

Lloyd's algorithm **monotonically decreases** $J$ at every step and converges to a local optimum in a finite number of iterations. However, the solution depends on initialization.

### K-Means++ Initialization

Instead of random initialization, **k-means++** chooses initial centroids with probability proportional to their squared distance from the nearest existing centroid:

$$ P(x) = \\frac{D(x)^2}{\\sum_{x'} D(x')^2} $$

where $D(x)$ is the distance from $x$ to the nearest already-chosen centroid. This provably yields an $O(\\log k)$-competitive approximation to the optimal WCSS.`,

    mathematics: `### Parameters

DBSCAN is defined by two parameters:
- **Epsilon ($\\varepsilon$)**: the radius of the neighborhood around each point
- **MinPoints**: the minimum number of points required to form a dense region

### Point Classification

For each point $p$ in the dataset, define its **$\\varepsilon$-neighborhood**:

$$ N_\\varepsilon(p) = \\{q \\in D : d(p, q) \\le \\varepsilon\\} $$

Points are classified into three categories:
- **Core Point**: $|N_\\varepsilon(p)| \\ge \\text{MinPoints}$
- **Border Point**: $|N_\\varepsilon(p)| < \\text{MinPoints}$, but $p \\in N_\\varepsilon(q)$ for some core point $q$
- **Noise Point**: neither core nor border

### Density Reachability

A point $q$ is **directly density-reachable** from $p$ if $p$ is a core point and $q \\in N_\\varepsilon(p)$.

A point $q$ is **density-reachable** from $p$ if there exists a chain of core points $p = p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k = q$ where each $p_{i+1}$ is directly density-reachable from $p_i$.

### Density Connectivity

Two points $p$ and $q$ are **density-connected** if there exists a point $o$ such that both $p$ and $q$ are density-reachable from $o$.

A cluster in DBSCAN is a maximal set of density-connected points. Any point not density-connected to any other point is classified as noise.`,

    mathematics: `### Covariance Matrix

PCA finds the eigenvectors of the data's **covariance matrix**. For mean-centered data $X_c$:

$$ \\Sigma = \\frac{1}{n-1} X_c^T X_c $$

The principal components are the eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalues of $\\Sigma$.

### Procedure

1. Center the data by subtracting the mean.
2. Optionally standardize features if they are on very different scales.
3. Compute the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$.
4. Compute eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\cdots \\ge \\lambda_p$ and corresponding eigenvectors $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_p$.
5. Project the data onto the top $k$ principal directions.

### SVD Connection

PCA can be computed efficiently via the **Singular Value Decomposition** of the centered data matrix:

$$ X_c = U \\Sigma_s V^T $$

The columns of $V$ are the principal component directions, the diagonal entries of $\\Sigma_s$ are the singular values, and the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix relate directly:

$$ \\lambda_j = \\frac{\\sigma_j^2}{n - 1} $$

### Explained Variance Ratio

The fraction of total variance captured by the $j$-th component is:

$$ \\text{EVR}_j = \\frac{\\lambda_j}{\\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\lambda_i} $$

This is used to decide how many components to keep. A common heuristic is to choose $k$ such that $\\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\text{EVR}_j \\ge 0.95$ (i.e., 95% of variance retained).

### Projection

To reduce from $p$ dimensions to $k$, multiply each centered observation by the matrix of the top $k$ eigenvectors:

    fullDescription:
      "Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) are feed-forward neural networks made of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each hidden layer applies a linear transformation followed by a non-linear activation, allowing the model to learn patterns that a simple linear model cannot represent. During training, the network performs a forward pass to produce predictions, computes a loss, and then uses backpropagation with gradient descent to update its weights.",
    intuition:
      "You can think of an MLP as a stack of progressively smarter feature detectors. Early neurons may respond to simple combinations of inputs, while deeper neurons combine those signals into more abstract patterns. By repeatedly comparing predictions with the true answer and nudging weights in the right direction, the network gradually shapes a useful decision boundary.",
    mathematics: `### Forward Pass

For an MLP with one hidden layer, the forward pass computes:

$$ z^{(1)} = W^{(1)}x + b^{(1)} $$
$$ a^{(1)} = f(z^{(1)}) $$
$$ z^{(2)} = W^{(2)}a^{(1)} + b^{(2)} $$
$$ \\hat{y} = g(z^{(2)}) $$

Where $f$ is a hidden-layer activation such as **ReLU** or **tanh**, and $g$ is task-dependent:
- **sigmoid** for binary classification
- **softmax** for multiclass classification
- **identity / linear output** for regression

### Loss Functions

For **binary classification** (sigmoid output):

$$ \\mathcal{L} = -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[y_i \\log \\hat{y}_i + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - \\hat{y}_i)\\right] $$

For **multiclass classification** (softmax output with $C$ classes):

$$ \\mathcal{L} = -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_{ic} \\log \\hat{y}_{ic} $$

### Backpropagation

Training uses the **chain rule** to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to every weight in the network.

For the output layer:

$$ \\delta^{(2)} = \\hat{y} - y \\quad \\text{(for cross-entropy + sigmoid/softmax)} $$
$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial W^{(2)}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\, \\delta^{(2)} (a^{(1)})^T $$

For the hidden layer, the error is propagated backward:

$$ \\delta^{(1)} = (W^{(2)})^T \\delta^{(2)} \\odot f'(z^{(1)}) $$
$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial W^{(1)}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\, \\delta^{(1)} x^T $$

where $\\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication and $f'$ is the derivative of the activation function.

### Parameter Update

A standard gradient descent update step is:

$$ W \\leftarrow W - \\eta \\nabla_W \\mathcal{L} $$

      "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed for grid-like data such as images. Instead of connecting every pixel to every neuron, CNNs apply small learnable filters across local regions, which makes them efficient and well suited to spatial data. Early layers often learn edges and textures, while deeper layers combine those into shapes, parts, and full objects.",
    intuition:
      'Imagine sliding a tiny window across an image and asking the same question everywhere: "Do I see an edge here? A corner? A texture?" CNNs reuse the same filter weights across the image, so they can detect the same pattern no matter where it appears. Stacking many layers lets the model move from simple visual cues to meaningful object-level understanding.',
    mathematics: `### Cross-Correlation (Convolution)

In most deep-learning libraries, the operation called "convolution" is implemented as **cross-correlation**:

$$ (I \\star K)(i, j) = \\sum_m \\sum_n I(i+m, j+n)\\,K(m, n) $$

For simplicity, this expression shows the single-channel case. In practice, CNNs sum over input channels as well.

### Output Size Formula

For an input of spatial size $W$, filter size $F$, padding $P$, and stride $S$:

$$ W_{\\text{out}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W - F + 2P}{S} \\right\\rfloor + 1 $$

This formula applies independently to each spatial dimension (height and width).

### Parameter Count

For a convolutional layer with $C_{\\text{in}}$ input channels, $C_{\\text{out}}$ output channels (filters), and kernel size $F \\times F$:

$$ \\text{Parameters} = C_{\\text{out}} \\times (C_{\\text{in}} \\times F^2 + 1) $$

The "+1" accounts for the bias term per filter.

### Receptive Field

The **receptive field** of a neuron in layer $l$ is the region of the input image that influences its activation. For a stack of $L$ layers each with kernel size $F$ and stride 1:

$$ R_L = 1 + L \\times (F - 1) $$

Deeper layers have larger receptive fields, enabling them to capture more global context.

### Pooling

Max pooling reduces spatial resolution by taking the maximum over a local neighborhood:

$$ y_{i,j} = \\max(\\text{local neighborhood}) $$

This provides some local translation invariance and reduces computation in deeper layers.

Parameter sharing and local receptive fields make CNNs much more efficient than fully connected layers on image-like data.`,

    intuition:
      "Unlike a feed-forward model that sees each input in isolation, an RNN keeps a running summary of what it has seen so far. Reading a sentence is a good analogy: the meaning of the current word depends heavily on the words before it. The hidden state acts like short-term memory, helping the network interpret each new token in context.",
    mathematics: `### Recurrence Relation

At time step $t$, an RNN updates its hidden state using the current input $x_t$ and previous state $h_{t-1}$:

$$ h_t = \\tanh(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b_h) $$

An output is then formed from the hidden state:

$$ o_t = W_y h_t + b_y $$
$$ \\hat{y}_t = g(o_t) $$

Where $g$ is chosen for the task, such as softmax for classification or the identity map for regression.

### Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

Training is performed with BPTT, which unrolls the recurrence over $T$ time steps. The gradient of the loss with respect to the hidden-to-hidden weights involves a product of Jacobians:

$$ \\frac{\\partial h_T}{\\partial h_t} = \\prod_{k=t+1}^{T} \\frac{\\partial h_k}{\\partial h_{k-1}} = \\prod_{k=t+1}^{T} \\text{diag}(f'(z_k)) \\, W_h $$

### Vanishing and Exploding Gradients

The repeated matrix multiplication in the gradient product creates instability:

$$ \\left\\|\\frac{\\partial h_T}{\\partial h_t}\\right\\| \\le \\|W_h\\|^{T-t} \\cdot \\prod_{k} \\|f'(z_k)\\| $$

- If the largest singular value of $W_h$ is $< 1$, the gradient **vanishes** exponentially as $T - t$ grows
- If the largest singular value is $> 1$, the gradient **explodes**

For **tanh** activation, $|f'(z)| \\le 1$, which compounds the vanishing problem.

### Gated Architectures

To address vanishing gradients, gated variants such as **LSTMs** and **GRUs** introduce additive pathways that let gradients flow more easily across long time intervals:

- **LSTM**: uses input, forget, and output gates plus a cell state
- **GRU**: uses reset and update gates (fewer parameters than LSTM)

These gating mechanisms learn when to remember, forget, or update information.`,
