  fullDescription: `
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used when a probability distribution is known up to proportionality, but direct integration or exact sampling is too difficult. This is common in Bayesian inference, where the posterior may be high-dimensional and analytically intractable.

MCMC builds a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the target distribution. After warm-up, the visited states behave like dependent samples from that target. Histograms, expectations, credible intervals, and posterior summaries can then be estimated from those samples.

### Where is it used?
MCMC is used in Bayesian modeling, physics simulation, hierarchical medical models, ecological inference, and risk analysis when closed-form calculations are not available.
  `,

  intuition: `
Imagine a landscape where height represents probability density. The sampler proposes nearby moves. Moves to higher-density regions are usually accepted, but some lower-density moves are accepted too.

That occasional willingness to move downhill matters. It keeps the chain from getting trapped at one local peak and lets it explore the distribution. The result is not a perfect map, but an approximation that improves with better proposals, diagnostics, and enough effective samples.
  `,

  mathematics: `
### 1. The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
To map out a target probability distribution $P(x)$, the algorithm is currently at state $x$. It proposes a random jump to a new state $x'$. It then calculates an acceptance ratio ($\\alpha$):

$$ \\alpha = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{P(x')}{P(x)}\\right) $$

This ratio asks whether the proposed state is more probable than the current state.
If $P(x')$ is greater than $P(x)$, the ratio is 1, and the algorithm *always* moves to the new spot. 
If the proposed state is less probable, the algorithm may still accept it with probability $\\alpha$. Otherwise, it stays at $x$ and records the current state again.

### 2. Why it works
Allowing occasional lower-density moves is crucial because it improves exploration. In practice, you still need convergence diagnostics, warm-up removal, and effective sample size checks before trusting the estimates.

  pros: [
    "It can estimate posterior quantities for models where direct integration is not feasible.",
    "It does not require a Gaussian posterior and can represent skewed, correlated, or multi-modal distributions if the chain mixes well."
  ],

  cons: [
    "It is notoriously slow. Taking millions of tiny random steps takes a lot of computing power and time.",
    "It can be very difficult to know exactly when the algorithm has 'finished' mapping the mountain. You often have to run multiple walkers at the same time to check if they agree."

      heading: 'Deriving the Metropolis-Hastings Acceptance Ratio',
      content: `
We want a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the target $p(x)$. A *sufficient* condition for $p$ to be stationary is **detailed balance** (reversibility): for every pair of states the probability flux in each direction must match,

$$ p(x)\\,T(x' \\mid x) = p(x')\\,T(x \\mid x') $$

where $T(x' \\mid x)$ is the chain's transition kernel. If this holds, summing both sides over $x$ gives $\\sum_x p(x)\\,T(x' \\mid x) = p(x')\\sum_x T(x \\mid x') = p(x')$, i.e. one application of the kernel maps $p$ to itself — $p$ is **invariant**.

Metropolis-Hastings factors the transition into a **proposal** $q(x' \\mid x)$ followed by an **accept/reject** step with acceptance probability $A(x' \\mid x)$, so for $x' \\neq x$,

$$ T(x' \\mid x) = q(x' \\mid x)\\,A(x' \\mid x) $$

Plugging this into detailed balance and rearranging gives a single requirement on the acceptance probabilities:

$$ \\frac{A(x' \\mid x)}{A(x \\mid x')} = \\frac{p(x')\\,q(x \\mid x')}{p(x)\\,q(x' \\mid x)} $$

The Metropolis-Hastings choice that satisfies this — while keeping each $A \\le 1$ and accepting as often as possible — is

$$ A(x' \\mid x) = \\min\\left(1, \\; \\frac{p(x')\\,q(x \\mid x')}{p(x)\\,q(x' \\mid x)}\\right) $$

Notice that $p$ appears **only as the ratio** $p(x')/p(x)$. If $p(x) = \\tilde{p}(x)/Z$ for some unknown constant $Z$, the $Z$ cancels: $p(x')/p(x) = \\tilde{p}(x')/\\tilde{p}(x)$. This is the crux of why MCMC works for Bayesian posteriors — we never need the intractable evidence $Z = \\int \\tilde{p}(x)\\,dx$. When the proposal is **symmetric**, $q(x' \\mid x) = q(x \\mid x')$, the proposal terms cancel too and we recover the original Metropolis ratio $A = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{p(x')}{p(x)}\\right)$.

      heading: 'From Samples to Estimates: Burn-in and Effective Sample Size',
      content: `
Once the chain has reached its stationary distribution, we approximate a posterior expectation by a simple average over the retained draws:

$$ \\mathbb{E}_{p}[f(x)] \\approx \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{t=1}^{N} f(x_t) $$

Two practical corrections stand between you and a trustworthy estimate. First, **burn-in (warm-up)**: the chain starts at an arbitrary point that may sit in a low-probability region, so the early states are *not* distributed according to $p$. We discard the first $B$ samples and average only over the rest.

Second, **autocorrelation**: because $x_{t+1}$ is proposed from $x_t$, consecutive draws are correlated. The variance of the Monte Carlo estimate is inflated relative to i.i.d. sampling, captured by the **effective sample size**

$$ \\text{ESS} = \\frac{N}{1 + 2\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\rho_k} $$

where $\\rho_k$ is the lag-$k$ autocorrelation. A chain of $N = 10{,}000$ draws with strong autocorrelation may have an ESS of only a few hundred — which is why mixing quality, not raw iteration count, governs estimate precision.
