  fullDescription: `
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the simplest and most intuitive algorithms in machine learning. It is a non-parametric method, meaning it does not assume any underlying mathematical shape for the data. Instead of training a model to find mathematical equations, KNN literally just memorizes the entire training dataset.

When you ask it to make a prediction for a new, unseen data point, it looks at the entire dataset, finds the $k$ data points that are geometrically closest (most similar) to the new point, and takes a vote. For classification, it returns the most common label among its neighbors; for regression, it returns the average value of its neighbors.

### Where is it used?
KNN is used in basic recommendation systems (finding users with similar movie tastes), anomaly detection (flagging transactions that are geometrically far from a user's normal spending clusters), and as a quick baseline algorithm before trying more complex models.
  `,
  intuition: `
Imagine you move to a new city and want to know if a specific neighborhood is safe. You don't need a complex mathematical formula; you just ask the 5 people who live closest to that neighborhood. If 4 out of 5 say it's safe, you assume it's safe. That's exactly how KNN works.
  `,
  mathematics: `
### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors Distance
KNN relies entirely on measuring the distance between a query data point $x$ and an existing database point $x'$. The most common distance metric is Euclidean distance:

$$ d(x, x') = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{p} (x_i - x_i')^2} $$

Other metrics like Manhattan distance ($L_1$ norm) or Cosine similarity (for text/embeddings) are also frequently used:

**Manhattan Distance**:
$$ d_1(x, x') = \\sum_{i=1}^{p} |x_i - x_i'| $$

      heading: 'How $k$ Controls the Bias-Variance Tradeoff',
      content: `
The single hyperparameter $k$ is the knob that moves KNN along the bias-variance spectrum, and you can see this directly in how the decision boundary behaves.

**Small $k$ (e.g. $k = 1$): low bias, high variance.** With $k = 1$ every training point owns a little territory (its Voronoi cell), and the prediction is whatever the single closest point says. The model bends to fit every point exactly, so the training error is **zero** — but the boundary is jagged and chases noise. Move one noisy point and the boundary near it flips. This is **overfitting**: high variance, low bias.

**Large $k$ (e.g. $k \\to n$): high bias, low variance.** As $k$ grows, each prediction averages over more neighbors, smoothing the boundary. In the limit $k = n$, every query gets the same answer — the global majority class — regardless of where it sits. The model ignores local structure entirely: low variance (it barely changes when data changes) but high bias (**underfitting**).

A useful way to see the variance is to look at the regression form of KNN, which predicts the mean of the $k$ neighbor targets:

$$ \\hat{f}(x) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i \\in N_k(x)} y_i $$

If the targets carry independent noise of variance $\\sigma^2$, the variance of this averaged estimate is

$$ \\operatorname{Var}\\big(\\hat{f}(x)\\big) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{k} $$

so variance falls as $1/k$ — doubling $k$ halves the variance. The cost is bias: averaging over a wider, less local neighborhood pulls the estimate away from the true value of $f$ at $x$. The sweet spot is found by cross-validation, and a common heuristic starting point is $k \\approx \\sqrt{n}$.
      `,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Distance Metrics and Why Scaling Is Non-Negotiable',
      content: `
KNN ranks neighbors by distance, so the *units* of your features directly determine who counts as "near". Consider a query point $q = (\\text{age}=30, \\text{income}=50000)$ and two candidate neighbors:

- $A = (\\text{age}=31, \\text{income}=50000)$ — one year older, identical income.
- $B = (\\text{age}=30, \\text{income}=50500)$ — same age, \\$500 more income.

**Raw (unscaled) Euclidean distances:**

$$ d(q, A) = \\sqrt{(30-31)^2 + (50000-50000)^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 $$

$$ d(q, B) = \\sqrt{(30-30)^2 + (50000-50500)^2} = \\sqrt{250000} = 500 $$

By this metric $A$ is "500 times closer" than $B$, purely because income is measured on a vastly larger numeric scale. Income's range swamps age; the age feature is effectively invisible. The fix is **standardization**, mapping each feature to zero mean and unit variance:

$$ z_i = \\frac{x_i - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i} $$

Suppose age has $\\sigma_{\\text{age}} = 1$ and income has $\\sigma_{\\text{income}} = 500$. After scaling, $A$ differs from $q$ by $1$ standard deviation in age, and $B$ differs by $1$ standard deviation in income — now the two are **equidistant** ($d = 1$ for both), which matches the intuition that "one year" and "one standard deviation of income" are comparable amounts of difference. Always fit the scaler on the training data only and reuse it on the test data to avoid leakage.

      difficulty: 'core',
      hint: 'With $k=1$ only the single closest point votes; with $k=4$ all points vote, so break a tie by a documented rule.',
      solution: 'With $k = 1$: the closest point is $A$ at distance $1$, which is class 1, so the prediction is **class 1**. With $k = 4$: all neighbors vote — classes are $\\{1, 1, 0, 0\\}$, a $2$-$2$ **tie**. Ties must be broken by a rule; a standard choice is to favor the class of the nearest tied neighbor, which is $A$ (class 1), giving **class 1**, though some implementations break ties by lowest class label (which would give class 0). The lesson: as $k$ grows the vote becomes less decisive, and even values of $k$ in binary problems can produce ties — which is why an odd $k$ is usually preferred for two-class problems.',

(a) Classify $q$ with $k = 1$ on the raw features. (b) Now standardize using $\\sigma_{\\text{height}} = 0.1$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{weight}} = 10$ and re-classify. Explain the difference.',
      difficulty: 'challenge',
      hint: 'Distance is dominated by whichever feature has the larger numeric range until you divide each difference by its standard deviation.',
      solution: '(a) Raw distances: $d(q, A) = \\sqrt{(1.7-1.8)^2 + (80-80)^2} = \\sqrt{0.01} = 0.1$; $d(q, B) = \\sqrt{(1.7-1.7)^2 + (80-70)^2} = \\sqrt{100} = 10$. So $A$ is far nearer and $q$ is predicted **class 1** — but only because weight (range in kg) dwarfs height (range in m). (b) Standardized differences: for $A$, height differs by $0.1/0.1 = 1$ SD and weight by $0$, giving $d = 1$. For $B$, height differs by $0$ and weight by $10/10 = 1$ SD, giving $d = 1$. After scaling the two neighbors are **equidistant** ($d = 1$ each), so the earlier "obvious" answer was an artifact of unscaled units, not real similarity. This is exactly why scaling is mandatory for KNN.',
