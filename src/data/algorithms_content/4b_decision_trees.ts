  fullDescription: `
Decision Trees are non-parametric supervised learning models used for both classification and regression. They work by partitioning the feature space into distinct regions through a series of recursive binary splits. 

Starting at the root node, the model checks a specific feature condition (e.g., "Is age < 30?"). If yes, it goes down the left branch; if no, it goes down the right branch. This process repeats at subsequent nodes until a leaf node is reached, which contains the final prediction.

### Where is it used?
Decision Trees are widely used in business, finance, and medicine, where model interpretability and transparency are critical (e.g., explaining why a loan was denied, or determining a patient's risk category based on symptoms). They also serve as the fundamental building block for ensemble models like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines.
  `,
  intuition: `
Imagine playing the game "20 Questions" to guess an animal. You don't ask "Does it have a tail?" first, because that doesn't narrow it down much. You ask "Is it a mammal?" because that splits the animal kingdom in half. A Decision Tree uses math to figure out the absolute best sequence of questions to ask to arrive at the right answer as fast as possible.
  `,
  mathematics: `
### 1. Splitting Criteria (Purity Metrics)
To find the best split at any node, the algorithm evaluates every possible feature split and measures the "impurity" (chaos) of the resulting child nodes. It aims to maximize the purity of the child nodes.

**Gini Impurity**: Measures how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. Lower is better:

$$ Gini(p) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i^2 $$

**Information Entropy**: Measures the amount of disorder or uncertainty in a node. Lower is better:

$$ Entropy(p) = - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \\log_2(p_i) $$

**Information Gain**: The difference in impurity before and after the split:

$$ Gain(D, A) = Impurity(D) - \\sum_{v \\in Values(A)} \\frac{|D_v|}{|D|} Impurity(D_v) $$

At a node holding a set $D$ of labeled examples, let $p_i$ be the fraction of examples in class $i$ (so $\\sum_i p_i = 1$). We need a number that is **small when the node is pure** (one class dominates) and **large when classes are evenly mixed**.

**Gini impurity** is the probability that two independent draws from the node's label distribution disagree — equivalently, the chance of mislabeling a random example if we label it by sampling from the same distribution:

$$ Gini(D) = \\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i (1 - p_i) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i^2 $$

For a pure node ($p_1 = 1$) it is $0$; for a balanced binary node ($p_1 = p_2 = 0.5$) it is $1 - (0.25 + 0.25) = 0.5$, its maximum for two classes.

**Entropy** measures the average information (in bits) needed to encode the class of a random example:

$$ H(D) = - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \\log_2(p_i) $$

It is $0$ for a pure node and $1$ bit for a balanced binary node ($-0.5\\log_2 0.5 - 0.5\\log_2 0.5 = 1$), its maximum for two classes. Both metrics share the same shape: minimized at purity, maximized at a uniform mix. Gini is slightly cheaper (no logarithm) and is the CART default, while entropy/information gain is the ID3/C4.5 default; in practice they rarely produce different trees.

      content: `
A parent node $D$ contains $10$ examples: $5$ positive and $5$ negative. We evaluate a candidate split on the feature "$age < 30$".

**Step 1 — parent impurity.** With $p_+ = p_- = 0.5$:

$$ Gini(D) = 1 - (0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 $$

**Step 2 — apply the split.** The condition sends examples into two children:

$$ D_L = \\{4\\text{ positive},\\, 1\\text{ negative}\\}, \\qquad D_R = \\{1\\text{ positive},\\, 4\\text{ negative}\\} $$

**Step 3 — child impurities.** For $D_L$, $p_+ = 0.8$, $p_- = 0.2$:

$$ Gini(D_L) = 1 - (0.8^2 + 0.2^2) = 1 - (0.64 + 0.04) = 0.32 $$

By symmetry $Gini(D_R) = 0.32$ as well.

**Step 4 — weighted child impurity.** Each child has $5$ of the $10$ examples:

$$ Gini_{split} = \\frac{5}{10}(0.32) + \\frac{5}{10}(0.32) = 0.32 $$

**Step 5 — information gain.** The impurity drop from parent to children:

$$ Gain = Gini(D) - Gini_{split} = 0.5 - 0.32 = 0.18 $$

A positive gain of $0.18$ means the split makes the node meaningfully purer. The tree compares this gain against every other candidate feature and threshold, and **greedily** keeps the one with the largest gain. If we had used entropy instead, the parent entropy would be $1$ bit, each child entropy $-0.8\\log_2 0.8 - 0.2\\log_2 0.2 \\approx 0.722$, weighted child entropy $0.722$, giving an information gain of $1 - 0.722 = 0.278$ bits — a different scale, but the same ordering of which split is best.
