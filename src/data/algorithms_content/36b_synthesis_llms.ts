  shortDescription: "A milestone case study synthesizing RAG, Fine-tuning, Inference, and Safety to design production-grade LLM systems.",
  fullDescription: `
This final milestone module focuses on the engineering architecture of modern Large Language Model systems. 

Building an LLM product rarely means training a foundation model from scratch. Instead, it involves a complex orchestration of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Fine-Tuning (LoRA)**, **Prompt Engineering**, **KV Cache Management**, and **Guardrails**. Deciding which tool to use for a specific problem is the defining skill of a modern AI engineer.

  intuition: `
### The Knowledge vs. Behavior Paradigm

When a model fails to perform a task, you must diagnose if it is a **Knowledge** failure or a **Behavior** failure.

*   **RAG (Retrieval):** Solves *Knowledge* failures. If the model doesn't know your company's internal HR policies, you don't fine-tune it; you inject the policy into the prompt via RAG.
*   **Fine-Tuning:** Solves *Behavior* failures. If the model knows the answer but writes it in a highly verbose, unhelpful format instead of the strict JSON schema you require, you fine-tune it to learn the desired output structure.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** The cheapest and fastest baseline for both, but breaks down when context windows overflow or complex multi-step reasoning is required.

  mathematics: `
### System-Level Mathematical Constraints

1.  **Context Window Costs:** The cost and latency of inference scale linearly with input tokens and quadratically in attention mechanisms. Dumping a 100-page document into the prompt is often vastly more expensive than running a vector search over 100 pages and only passing the top 3 paragraphs to the LLM.
2.  **Fine-Tuning Parameter Count:** Full fine-tuning of a 70B parameter model requires updating $7 \\times 10^{10}$ weights, requiring massive VRAM. LoRA mathematically decomposes this into low-rank matrices, reducing the trainable parameters by $10,000\\times$, making it feasible on a single GPU.

    {
      title: "Building an Internal Coding Assistant",
      scenario: "A company wants an AI coding assistant that understands their massive, undocumented legacy, proprietary codebase. The engineering team suggests fine-tuning Llama-3 on all the code.",
      approach: "Fine-tuning is rejected because it is notoriously bad at fact-recall. The model will likely hallucinate function names. Instead, a complex RAG pipeline is built: codebase files are chunked, embedded, and stored in a vector database. When a user asks a question, the relevant code snippets are retrieved and injected into the prompt.",
      outcome: "The RAG system achieves 95% accuracy in answering codebase queries, whereas the fine-tuned model suffered from severe hallucination and catastrophic forgetting."

  practiceExercises: [
    {
      prompt: "You are designing an AI agent to automatically parse incoming customer emails and trigger API calls. The agent consistently extracts the right information but outputs invalid JSON that breaks your API. Explain whether you should use RAG or Fine-Tuning to fix this, and justify your answer based on the Knowledge vs. Behavior paradigm.",
      difficulty: "challenge",
      hints: [
        "Does the model lack the necessary information to answer the question?",
        "Is the failure related to the *format* and *style* of the output?"
      ],
      solution: "This is a classic **Behavior** failure. The model has the Knowledge (it extracts the right info), but fails to adhere to a strict structural behavior. You should use **Fine-Tuning** (specifically, LoRA on a dataset of strictly formatted JSON outputs). RAG is useless here because adding more context to the prompt won't teach the model the strict syntactic adherence required."

  shortAnswerQuestions: [
    {
      question: "Design an end-to-end architecture for a highly regulated Medical Diagnostic Assistant. The system must process patient symptoms, reference the latest 2026 medical journals (which are updated daily), provide a diagnosis, and guarantee zero toxic/harmful outputs. Detail your choices regarding RAG, Fine-Tuning, Inference, and Safety.",
      expectedAnswerRubric: `
**Self-Grading Rubric:**
1.  **Dynamic Knowledge:** Did you propose a **RAG** system connected to a vector database of the medical journals? (Fine-tuning is incorrect here because journals update daily, and re-training daily is infeasible).
2.  **Domain Behavior:** Did you propose **Fine-Tuning** (Instruction Tuning) a base model on a high-quality dataset of doctor-patient interactions so the tone is empathetic and professional?
3.  **Safety/Guardrails:** Did you include a dedicated **Safety Evaluation/Guardrail** mechanism? (e.g., an independent "Judge LLM" or rule-based classifier that intercepts the output before it reaches the patient to scan for high-risk medical advice or toxicity).
4.  **Inference Considerations:** Did you address inference reliability? (e.g., setting temperature to 0.0 for deterministic, factual outputs rather than creative hallucinations).
