    title: "Spam Filter: Every Word Tugs the Verdict",
    subtitle: "Toggle words in the email; each one pulls the decision toward spam or ham by how often it appears in each, until the running total crosses the 50/50 line.",
    insight: "Naive Bayes adds up each word's log-likelihood ratio, so one strong word can tip a borderline email across the decision line.",
  },
  "gmm-em": {
    component: GMMEMViz,
    title: "Gaussian Mixtures and Expectation-Maximization",
    subtitle: "Alternate soft assignments and parameter updates for a mixture model.",
    insight: "EM improves latent-variable models by alternating inference and parameter estimation.",
  },
  backpropagation: {
    component: BackpropagationViz,
    title: "Backprop: Assigning Blame for the Error",
    subtitle: "A neuron predicts the wrong number. Watch the error flow backward and split into a gradient on each weight — then step downhill and watch the loss fall.",
    insight: "Backpropagation computes every weight's gradient in one backward sweep by passing blame through the chain rule, which is what makes training large models feasible.",
  },
  "sequence-models": {
    component: SequenceModelsViz,
    title: "Why RNNs Forget: Memory Decays Exponentially",
    subtitle: "Each time step multiplies the signal by the same factor. Drag it: below 1 the start of the sequence fades to nothing, above 1 it explodes, and only near 1 does memory survive a long sequence.",
    insight: "Repeated multiplication across time steps is exponential, so a plain RNN's memory either vanishes or explodes — which is exactly why LSTMs, gradient clipping, and attention exist.",
  },
  "embeddings-tokenization": {
    component: EmbeddingsTokenizationViz,
    title: "The Model Sees Tokens, Not Words",
    subtitle: "Before anything else, a tokenizer chops text into subword pieces with integer IDs. Type a sentence and watch common words stay whole while rare or long ones shatter into pieces — and the token count climb.",
    insight: "Models read a fixed vocabulary of subword tokens, not words, so 'tokenization' is two tokens and your API cost and context window are measured in tokens.",
  },
  rag: {
    component: RAGViz,
    title: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Grounding the Answer",
    subtitle: "Ask about a private fact the model never trained on. With retrieval off it confidently makes one up; turn it on and the matching document is pulled from the knowledge base, so the answer becomes correct and cited.",
    insight: "RAG fixes hallucination without retraining by retrieving the most relevant documents at question time and answering from them — so quality hinges on the retrieval step.",
  },
  "fine-tuning": {
    component: FineTuningViz,
    title: "LoRA: Adapt a Giant Model by Training a Sliver",
    subtitle: "Full fine-tuning retrains every weight in a layer. LoRA freezes them and trains two thin low-rank matrices instead — drag the rank and watch the trainable count stay a tiny fraction of the whole.",
    insight: "A weight update can be approximated by two small low-rank matrices, so LoRA specializes a model by training under ~1% of its parameters — cheap to train, store, and swap.",
  },
  "llm-evaluation-safety": {
    component: LLMEvalSafetyViz,
    title: "No Single Best Model: Picking by Priorities",
    subtitle: "Three models trade quality and safety against cost and speed. Reweight what matters — or pick a use-case preset — and watch the top model flip. There is no winner on every axis.",
    insight: "Model selection is multi-objective: capability, safety, cost, and latency trade off, so the right choice depends on which axes your use case weights — and safety is a first-class axis.",
  },
  "ai-inference": {
    component: AIInferenceViz,
    title: "The Memory Wall: Will This Model Even Run?",
    subtitle: "Weights plus a growing KV cache must fit in GPU VRAM. Push the model size, context, or batch and the bar overflows the GPU's limit into OUT OF MEMORY — then quantize and watch it fit again.",
    insight: "Inference is memory-bound: weights are fixed but the KV cache grows with context and batch, so quantization and hardware limits decide whether a model can serve at all.",
  },
  "image-segmentation": {
    component: ImageSegmentationViz,
    title: "Segmentation: A Class for Every Pixel, Scored by Overlap",
    subtitle: "A model predicts a per-pixel probability that each cell belongs to the object. Drag the threshold to turn those probabilities into a hard mask and watch Dice and IoU rise and fall as misses and false alarms trade off.",
    insight: "Segmentation is per-pixel classification graded by mask overlap (Dice / IoU), so the threshold trades recall against precision — there is a sweet spot that maximizes overlap.",
  },
  "vision-transformers": {
    component: VisionTransformersViz,
    title: "Patches, Not Pixels: A Global Receptive Field in One Layer",
    subtitle: "Pick any patch as the attention query and watch where it looks. In ViT mode it attends across the whole image to patches with similar content; switch to CNN mode and it is boxed into a 3×3 neighborhood — the locality bias a Vision Transformer trades away.",
    insight: "A Vision Transformer turns an image into a sequence of patch tokens and lets every patch attend to every other one, so a single self-attention layer already has a global, content-based receptive field — flexibility that costs data but pays off at scale.",
  },
  "diffusion-models": {
    component: DiffusionViz,
    title: "Bury an Image in Noise, Then Learn to Dig It Out",
    subtitle: "Slide the diffusion step right to watch the closed-form forward process mix shrinking signal with growing noise until the image is pure static; slide left to imagine the reverse process, and watch the model's single-step denoised estimate sharpen as the noise recedes.",
    insight: "Diffusion defines a fixed forward process that turns any image into Gaussian noise, then trains a network to reverse it — so generation starts from pure noise and denoises step by step, and denoising is easy near the data but hard far from it.",
  },
  "model-evaluation": {
    component: ModelEvaluationViz,
    title: "One Model, Many Operating Points: The Threshold Sweep",
    subtitle: "Drag the decision threshold and watch the confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 all move while the pink dot slides along a fixed ROC curve. The model never changes — only where you choose to operate it does.",
    insight: "Classification quality is not one number: the threshold trades precision against recall, the confusion matrix counts both error types, and threshold-independent summaries like ROC-AUC describe the model while you still must choose an operating point.",
  },
  "gradient-boosting": {
    component: GradientBoostingViz,
    title: "Add Trees That Fix What's Left Over",
    subtitle: "Start from the mean and add shallow trees one at a time, each fit to the yellow residuals. Raise the tree count to watch the green ensemble curve bend toward the data, and change the learning rate to feel the shrinkage trade-off between smooth fitting and chasing noise.",
    insight: "Gradient boosting descends the loss one shallow tree at a time, each fit to the current residuals; a small learning rate with many trees regularizes by averaging out noise instead of letting any one tree overfit.",
  },
